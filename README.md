# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This webpage contains a really short description of myself, and is a site that will show the other projects as they are completed.
It contains the schedule for all project releases and due dates, as well as specifications. The site will be updated when more information is released, or when projects are completed.
It is composed of 5 html pages, the homepage (index.html), and the description pages of the next 4 pages (project1.html to project4.html).
Right now, these 4 pages are a bit bare as the projects have not yet been done, but will be updated to contain descriptions of the project, as well as the tools used in making the project.

Through this website, I plan on documenting my progress during this course.

Changes in design are likely in the future :))
